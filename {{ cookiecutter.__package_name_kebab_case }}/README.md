## Install CLI apps

Use [PIPX](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install this package from Github.

```bash
{%- if 'github' not in cookiecutter.package_url %}
pipx install git+{{ cookiecutter.package_url }}
{%- elif 'http' in cookiecutter.package_url %}
pipx install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@{{ cookiecutter.package_url | replace('https://', '') }}
{%- else %}
pipx install git+https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@{{ cookiecutter.package_url | replace('git@', '') }}
{%- endif %}
```

Running the above command will install all script entry points as standalone scripts in the users' PATH.

**Note: You must be authenticated on Github for this to work**

**_Alternative_**
You can install from the local filesystem. This approach will create a link to the _editable version_ of the script which may cause problems if you plan on developing from that directory.

```bash
pipx install ~/path/to/project
```
